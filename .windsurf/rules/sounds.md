## Viral Sound Integration Rules

- Only use high-quality, remix-legal audio sources (SoundBoardW, MyInstants, Voicy).  
- Sounds must support layeringâ€”for mashups at runtime.  
- Live sound mashups allowed during streaming mode.  
- AI voice clones allowed for Risottini voice expansion, but must pass quick TTS preview tests.  
- Always respect user controls: mute, volume slider, global preference save.  
- Validate audio formats (e.g., .mp3, .wav); auto-convert if needed.
- Language; Italian, Croatian, Indonesian, English
